            <h3>zeughauskeller in Zurich</h3>
            <img src="imgs/Zurich city.jpg" width="750" height="500">
            <br>
            <h5>zeughauskeller is located in a building that was built in 1487 as an arsenal store house. Legend has it that this was where William Tell was issued his crossbow. The building has been home to Restaurant Zeughauskeller since 1926. The restaurant’s décor includes oak beams, historic artefacts and weapons. The menu offers rustic Swiss cuisine, from hearty meat dishes and regionally sourced sausages to rösti. All selections are based on tried and true traditional recipes.

                <img src="imgs/maximo mexico.jpg" width="750" height="500">
                <br>
                <h5>The approach at Máximo Bistrot, a regular on Latin America’s 50 Best, is all about locality and sustainability. The philosophy doesn’t just apply to the food, with the majority of ingredients sourced from farms in and around Mexico City, but also extends to the dishware, napkins and furniture, which are all fair trade as well as local. Eduardo García’s menu changes daily, with hits including organic roast chicken, Creole carrot purée and mole and seared tuna with artichoke puree. For a simpler experience, try the sister site, Lalo, over the road, with pizza, pasta and appetisers served at one long communal table.</h5>

                <h3>pier in Cape Town</h3>
                <img src="imgs/pier cape town.jpg">
                <br>
                <h5>The newest addition to Scot Kirton’s restaurant empire is not “just another” La Colombe experience. Pier promises culinary adventure and theatrics, as expected, but with John Norris-Rogers in charge, the focus is clearly on the best flavours coaxed from the best local produce. On offer is a set of 9 or 11 dishes running the gauntlet of the La Colombe group’s skills with aplomb – from the very first “snack” to the petit fours offered with the bill.
                    We were particularly impressed by the depth of flavour from the bone marrow butter with the bread course; the sublime tableside-poached oysters (in MCC velouté, and just warmed through to perfection); and the seamless integration of mussels, soubise and Black Forest ham. As for the crayfish course… so sensitively prepared, you could taste the sea. The lamb and aubergine with Israeli couscous and harissa stole the show, an intense ras-el-hanout jus perfectly complemented by the young pinotage served alongside.
                    The extra cheese course (all South African) is a joy to anyone averse to dessert, and the best we’ve had locally. The team traverses a spider-silk thread between theatrics, molecular gastronomy and old-fashioned French technique, overshadowing even the floor-to-ceiling vistas of the harbour and the elegantly understated décor. A dining experience of this stellar quality in the Waterfront is long overdue.
